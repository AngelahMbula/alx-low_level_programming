How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators

0.Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.



Prototype: unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);

1.Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.



Prototype: void print_binary(unsigned long int n);

2.Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.



Prototype: int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index);

3.write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

4.write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

5.write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
